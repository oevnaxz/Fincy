    persistent.mc "Keith said that Ray spent a good amount of time explaining his viewpoint."
    persistent.mc "In their business plan, Ray knew that the primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises."
    persistent.mc "But what he never lost sight of was the location of each franchise. He knew that the real estate and its location was the most {b}significant{/b} factor in the success of each franchise."
    persistent.mc "Basically, the person that bought the franchise was also paying for, buying the land under the franchise for Ray's organization."

    persistent.mc "Basically, they work first for the owners of the company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank that owns their mortgage."

    persistent.mc "And as a young boy back then, we didn't actually have a McDonald's nearby."

    persistent.mc "Many people will have nothing at the end of their working days."
    persistent.mc "Our current educational system focuses on preparing today's youth to get good jobs by developing scholastic skills."
    persistent.mc "Their lives will revolve around their wages, or as described earlier, their income column" 
    persistent.mc "And after developing scholastic skills, they go on to higher levels of schooling to enhance their professional abilities."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "They study to become engineers, scientists, cooks, police officers, artists, writers and so on."

    persistent.mc "{b}HOWEVER!{/b} There is a big difference between your profession and your business." with vpunch
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "I often ask people this question..."
    persistent.mc "“{i}What is your business{/i}?”"
    persistent.mc "And they will say “{i}Oh I'm a banker{/i}.”"
    persistent.mc "Then I ask them if they own the bank and they usually respond: “{i}No, I {b}work{/b} there{/i}.”"
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "In that instance... they have confused their profession with their business."
    persistent.mc "Their profession may be a banker, but they still need their {b}OWN{/b} business."
    persistent.mc "Ray Kroc was clear on the difference between his profession and his business."
    persistent.mc "His profession was always the same. He was always a salesman."
    persistent.mc "At one time he sold mixers for milkshakes and soon thereafter, he was selling hamburger franchises."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "But while his profession was selling hamburger franchises his business was the accumulation of income-producing real estate."
    persistent.mc "Now that it has come to this, I would like to give my opinion about something."
    persistent.mc "You know, the problem with school is that you often become what you study. There's nothing wrong with that right?"
    persistent.mc "So if you study, let's say... cooking, you then become a chef."
    persistent.mc "If you study the law, you become an attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic."
    persistent.mc "{b}HOWEVER!{/b} The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business." with vpunch
    persistent.mc "So, what am I implying here?"
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Well, most people spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that person rich."
    persistent.mc "To become financially secure a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column."
    persistent.mc "And as I have stated earlier..."
    persistent.mc "The no. 1 rule is to know the difference between an {b}asset{/b} and a {b}liability{/b}, after that, you then buy assets."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements."
    persistent.mc "{i}That is why we hear phrases like these so often{/i}"
    persistent.mc "“I need a raise.”, “If only I had a promotion.”"
    persistent.mc "“I am going to go back to school to get more training so I can get a better job.”, “I am going to work overtime.”"
    persistent.mc "“Maybe I can get a second job.”, “I'm quitting in two weeks. I found a job that pays more.”"
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "In some circles, these are sensible ideas, in fact, really sensible."
    persistent.mc "Yet, if you listened to Ray Kroc's piece of advice, you are still {b}NOT{/b} minding your own business."
    persistent.mc "These ideas all still focus on the income column and will only help a person become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating assets."

    persistent.mc "The primary reason most of the poor and middle class are fiscally conservative-which means that they can't afford to take risks..."
    show mc casual sad with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Is that they have no financial foundation. They must cling to their jobs. They must play it safe."
    persistent.mc "And when downsizing in their companies became the “in” thing to do... millions of workers found out their largest so-called {i}asset{/i}"

    persistent.mc "Without job security, they had nothing to fall back on."
    persistent.mc "What they thought were assets could not help them survive in a time of financial crisis."
    persistent.mc "Assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to buy a house or to buy a car. It is always interesting to look at the “{i}net worth{/i}” section."
    persistent.mc "It is interesting because of what accepted banking and accounting practices allow a person to count those properties as assets."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "I {i}cringe{/i} every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains."
    persistent.mc "So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets."
    persistent.mc "First, their personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of the value that is listed in their personal balance sheet."
    persistent.mc "Or if there is a gain on the sale of the assets, they are taxed on the gain."
    show mc casual sad with dissolve
    persistent.mc "So again... the government takes its share of the gain, thus reducing the amount available to help them out of debt."
    persistent.mc "That is why I say someone's net worth is often “worth less” than they think."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Start minding your own business."
    persistent.mc "What I mean by that is keep your daytime job, but start buying {b}REAL{/b} assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot."
    persistent.mc "It is not a true asset even if your banker lets you list it as one."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "And as for adults..."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve 
    persistent.mc "Well, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid assets."
    persistent.mc "For young people who have not yet left home. It is important for parents to teach them the difference between an asset and a liability."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Parents should get them to start building a solid asset column before they leave home, get married, buy a house, have kids and get stuck in a risky financial position."
    persistent.mc "Which would make them cling into a job and buying everything on credit."
    show mc casual sad with dissolve
    persistent.mc "I see so many young couples who get married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not let them get out of debt for most of their working years. (Ehem chapter 2)"
    persistent.mc "For most people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize they have not adequately prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble to put some money away."
    persistent.mc "Then, their own parents become ill, and they find themselves with new responsibilities, which clearly, no one wants to happen."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "So! What kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children acquire?" with vpunch
    persistent.mc "Well, in my world, real assets fall into several different categories."
    persistent.mc "1. {b}Businesses that do not require my presence{/b}. I own them, but they are managed or run by other people."
    persistent.mc "If I have to work there, it's not a business, but it becomes my job."
    persistent.mc "And as a young boy... my educated dad encouraged me to find a {i}safe{/i} job. Well, most dads give that advice."
    persistent.mc "My rich dad, on the other hand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I {b}LOVED{/b}."
    persistent.mc "I remember him saying “{i}If you don't love it, you won't take care of it{/i}.”"
    persistent.mc "And... I followed it. I collected real estate properties simply because I love buildings and land."
    persistent.mc "I love shopping for them."
    persistent.mc "I could look at them all day long. When problems arise, the problems are not so bad that it changes my love for real estate."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "For people who hate real estate, they shouldn't buy it. It may be simple, but keep this in mind if you plan to invest on a project!"
    persistent.mc "Many people are afraid of {i}small-cap{/i} companies and call them risky, and they really are."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "But risk is always diminished if you love what the investment is, understand it and know the game."
    persistent.mc "Okay, I'll let you in on a secret. Listen carefully, alright?"
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "My real estate strategy, is to start small and keep trading the properties up for bigger properties and..."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Therefore, delaying paying taxes on the gain."
    persistent.mc "This allows the value to increase dramatically."
    persistent.mc "For years, even while I was job-hopping, I did what my rich dad recommended."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my asset column."
    persistent.mc "I traded real estate and small stocks."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Rich dad always stressed the importance of financial literacy."
    persistent.mc "The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the better I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company."
    persistent.mc "Oh and when I say mind your own business..."
    persistent.mc "I mean to build and keep your asset column strong."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Once a dollar goes into it, {b}NEVER{/b} let it come out."
    persistent.mc "Think of it this way, once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your {i}employee{/i}."
    persistent.mc "The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations."
    persistent.mc "Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working employee, but keep building that asset column."
    persistent.mc "And as your cash flow grows, you can buy those luxuries and your wants!"
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first."
    persistent.mc "The poor and the middle class often buy luxury items such as {i}big houses{/i}, {i}diamonds{/i}, {i}furs{/i}, and {i}jewelries{/i} because they want to look rich."
    show mc casual sad with dissolve
    persistent.mc "Yes, they might look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "The {i}old-money{/i} people, the long-term rich, builds their asset column first."
    persistent.mc "Then, the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries."
    persistent.mc "The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own {b}blood{/b}, {b}sweat{/b} and {b}children's inheritance{/b}."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset."
    persistent.mc "For example, when my wife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses..."
    persistent.mc "She went out and bought a Mercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on her part because the apartment house {b}BOUGHT{/b} the car."
    persistent.mc "She did, however, must wait for it for {b}four{/b} years while the real estate investment portfolio grew and finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the car."
    persistent.mc "But the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to grow her asset column."
    show mc casual defaultEmotion with dissolve
    persistent.mc "That car now means a lot more to her than simply another {i}pretty{/i} car. It means she used her financial intelligence to afford it."
    show mc casual sad with dissolve
    persistent.mc "What most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some other luxury, on credit."
    persistent.mc "They may feel bored and just want a new toy."
    persistent.mc "Buying a luxury on credit often causes a person to sooner or later actually resent that luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a financial burden."
    show mc casual smiling with dissolve
    persistent.mc "The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own business - it really feels satisfying once you're able to get it."
